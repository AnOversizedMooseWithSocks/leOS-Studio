"""GPUREPORT-1 -- what GPU is available, and would offloading actually pay (holographic_gpureport).

The GPU mirror of `cpu_budget` / `should_pool`, and deliberately the same shape: one function that reports
what the machine HAS, one that decides whether using it PAYS for a specific job. The answer depends on the
caller's numbers, so it is computed rather than assumed — the same rule the machine model's placement oracle
and the bundle-capacity advisor follow.

WHY A REPORT WAS NEEDED AT ALL
------------------------------
There was no way to ask this engine about its own GPU situation. `use_gpu(True)` returns a bare bool that
conflates four different states — no CuPy installed, CuPy present but no device, device present but the
policy forbids it, and actually enabled — and a caller seeing `False` could not tell which. That matters
because three of those four are fixable by the user and one is not.

TWO INDEPENDENT GPU PATHS, AND THE REPORT COVERS BOTH
  * CuPy   — CUDA/NVIDIA only, transparent (kernels route by follow-the-data dispatch).
  * WGSL   — Vulkan / Metal / DX12 / WebGPU via wgpu, explicit (you dispatch an emitted kernel).
A machine can have neither, either, or both, and "do I have a GPU" has a different answer per path. A report
that only knew about CuPy would tell an Apple or AMD user they have no GPU, which is false.

THE PRE-GATE, AND THE HONEST STATE OF ITS CONSTANT
--------------------------------------------------
The backend's own docstring states the rule — a big FFT-or-matmul wins because the transfer amortises, a
tiny per-call op on one (D,) vector loses — but nothing enforced it, so a caller could flip `use_gpu(True)`
and get a slowdown with no warning. `should_offload` enforces it.

ITS THRESHOLD IS PROVISIONAL AND SAYS SO. Measuring the real host<->device crossover requires a GPU, and
none has been available in any environment this engine has run in. What ships is the SHAPE of the gate with
a conservative default drawn from the arithmetic of PCIe bandwidth, marked as unmeasured. That is the same
honesty `should_pool` carries about its 0.2 ms dispatch figure, and the same reason: a number without a
measurement behind it is a placeholder, and calling it anything else is how folklore constants are born.
